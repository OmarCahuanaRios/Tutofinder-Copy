 I want to create a report about the tutorship
 So my clients can see the developement

 Given the tutor has to create an inform after every tutorship
  When the tutorship has ended
  Then the “Realizar reporte” option will appear.

 When they go to the option “anterior”
 Then  the report interface will appear with the previous information. 

Scenario: Send report
 Given the tutor wants to send the report
 When they finish editing the report, they need to select the “siguiente” option
 Then the interface with the filled report will appear so they can verify the info so they can select the “Enviar” option.

  When they make a complain
  Then the tutor has to edit it so the client has agreed.
